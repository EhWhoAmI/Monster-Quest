Monster Quest
===============
### A fun RPG game

This is RPG game made by me. Please try it out when it is ready.

The first version, or the pre-alpha, or indev, or whatever you want to call it, will come out in March 2017, I hope.

### A very short summary of this game

You are supposed to fight these monsters that are fighting innocent villagers. We are planning to have quite a big map and stuff. Well, you get to explore caves, mountains and stuff.

### How to help
Please help, it takes quite a bunch of time to make it... If you want, you can just test it, and I'll be happy. Please see in the TODO section in projects if you want to code the thing.

### Website
The website is here, at [https://ehwhoami.github.io/Monster-Quest/] (https://ehwhoami.github.io/Monster-Quest/) Its quite basic, but I will update it oftenly.

### Classes

Not much has been done about character classes. The concepts have come out though,
 
 - Swordsman/Swordswoman - They carry swords, and deal great damage over places. They are fast, and have good armour
 - Warrior - Big, strong, they are powerful. They have high damage, 
and bash everyhing in their paths. But, they have ZERO armour
 - Wizard/Witch - These guys do magic, and their spells are feared from around the land. They have improved effect dealing, and medium range.
 - Archer - They pick off enemies from afar. They have the best range, and can fire fire arrows, and poison arrows. They have higher speed, but lower armour and health.
### Notes
  - We use the xom library for XML parsing. The website can be found [here](http://xom.nu)
  - This game is still in development
  - We are coming up with the images for the classes!
