### A fun RPG game :octocat:

This is RPG game made by me. Please try it out when it is ready.

The first version, or the pre-alpha, or indev, or whatever you want to call it, will come out in March 2017, I hope.

### A very short summary of this game

You are supposed to fight these monsters that are fighting innocent villagers. We are planning to have quite a big map and stuff. Well, you get to explore caves, mountains and stuff.

### How to help :wrench:
Please help, it takes quite a bunch of time to make it... If you want, you can 
just test it, and I'll be happy. Please see in the TODO section in projects if 
you want to code the thing.

If you want to add an idea, go to issues, type a title and description, amd add the
idea label to it. Be specific, or it will not pass. Your idea might pass, but it
is not guaranteed. Also, your idea might be subject to balancing, for better and more
fair gameplay. Btw, if you add images, there will have an even higher chance.

### Website
The website is here, at [https://ehwhoami.github.io/Monster-Quest/](https://ehwhoami.github.io/Monster-Quest/) Its quite basic, but I will update it oftenly.

### Classes

Not much has been done about character classes. The concepts have come out though,
 
 - Swordsman/Swordswoman - They carry swords, and deal great damage over places. They are fast, and have good armour 
 
 ![Sword Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EhWhoAmI/Monster-Quest/master/resources/images/tutorial/SwordImage.png)
 - Warrior - Big, strong, they are powerful. They have high damage, and bash everyhing in their paths. But, they have ZERO armour. 
 
 ![Axe Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EhWhoAmI/Monster-Quest/master/resources/images/tutorial/AxeImage.png)
 - Wizard/Witch - These guys do magic, and their spells are feared from around the land. They have improved effect dealing, and medium range. 
 
 ![Wand Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EhWhoAmI/Monster-Quest/master/resources/images/tutorial/WandImage.png)
 - Archer - They pick off enemies from afar. They have the best range, and can fire fire arrows, and poison arrows. They have higher speed, but lower armour and health.
