Monster Quest 
===============
### A open source RPG game
This RPG game is made by [EhWhoAmI](https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/). I have spent many afternoons after school trying to do this game. I hope it will be fun enough.

This game will ALWAYS be open source, and free, because this is a hobby, and I do not feel like earning anything from this.

### A very short summary of this game

You are supposed to fight these monsters that are fighting innocent villagers. We are planning to have quite a big map and stuff. Well, you get to explore caves, mountains and stuff.
But, we will start off small, maybe a few maps and weapons.

We are in the progress of "pixelating" this game, or making all the graphics into pixels. It WILL take some time.

### How to help :wrench:
Please help, it takes quite a bunch of time to make it... If you want, you can just test it, and I'll be happy. Please see in the TODO section in projects if you want to code the thing.

### Website
The website is here, at [https://ehwhoami.github.io/Monster-Quest/] (https://ehwhoami.github.io/Monster-Quest/) Its quite basic, but I will update it oftenly.

### Classes

Not much has been done about character classes. The concepts have come out though,

 - Swordsman/Swordswoman - They carry swords, and deal great damage over places. They are fast, and have good armour

 - Warrior - Big, strong, they are powerful. They have high damage, and bash everyhing in their paths. But, they have ZERO armour. 
 
 ![Axe Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EhWhoAmI/Monster-Quest/master/resources/images/tutorial/AxeImage.png)
 - Wizard/Witch - These guys do magic, and their spells are feared from around the land. They have improved effect dealing, and medium range. 
 
 ![Wand Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EhWhoAmI/Monster-Quest/master/resources/images/tutorial/WandImage.png)
 - Archer - They pick off enemies from afar. They have the best range, and can fire fire arrows, and poison arrows. They have higher speed, but lower armour and health.

Small side note: We will add the charaters in the website, but not here, because it will be too messy.
### Notes
  - We use the xom library for XML parsing. The website can be found [here](http://xom.nu)
